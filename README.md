This web app is built using a JavaScript library called draft.js, which enables the rich text editing functionality of the app. When a user creates or edits a document, draft.js handles the rendering of the text, including the formatting, layout, and styling. 

It also uses Firebase, a cloud-based platform for storing and syncing data, to store all the user's data. It also have support for auto saving. 

To ensure the security of user data,it uses NextAuth.js, a library for handling authentication, to manage user login and authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access a user's documents and account information.



## Technologies I've used üë®‚Äçüíª

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) 
- [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) 
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Material Tailwind](https://material-tailwind.com/) 
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 

## How to start? üî∞

### Create Next app

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, `cd` into the directory you‚Äôd like to create the app in, and run the following command:

```bash
$ npx create-next-app <project-name>
```
After that visit the directory and start the server by using-
```
$ cd <project-name>
$ npm run dev
```
if you are using `yarn` then to start the server type `yarn dev` in the terminal.

### Setup Tailwind CSS 

```bash
$ npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
$ npx tailwindcss init -p
```
We need to update `tailwind.config.js` to do that look at [Tailwind CSS Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) and folllow the steps.
 
### Setting `.env.local`
`.env.local` has three values which you need to pass to run this project. 

- **`NEXTAUTH_URL`**:  In the development mode, it should be https://localhost:3000 and in production, you need to change it to your website homepage URL.

	
- **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`** & **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`**: go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and login with you gmail. Then Create a new Project and fill all the necessary information and click on **Create** button.

After creating a project there will be a search bar in that search for **APIs & Services** or just [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard). After visiting the page you need to make sure that you have selected you project or swithc the project if needed.

After that there will a form which needs to be filled. After filling that form save the data. And go to credential again and Create a new Credentials.
As you progress further then there will be some field which you need to fill very carefully.
It should be the **Domain** of your web app such as `https://example.com`

After that you need to fill the redirect URI or callback URL which will show when you click on login button.
For the producation it should be like `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google`

After completing all the process you'll get your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** on the top-right corner which will look something like this-

## ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING‚ö†Ô∏è
> I want to inform you in advance that it is not very secure and the admin (which is me) can see the documents created by the other users for now. It's not end-to-end encrypted. I have made this just for fun and to learn something new. It is my responsibility to let you know about the downside of it. The below images show how It looks like from my perspective.

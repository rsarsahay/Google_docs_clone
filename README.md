This web app is built using a JavaScript library called draft.js, which enables the rich text editing functionality of the app. When a user creates or edits a document, draft.js handles the rendering of the text, including the formatting, layout, and styling. 

It also uses Firebase, a cloud-based platform for storing and syncing data, to store all the user's data. It also have support for auto saving. 

To ensure the security of user data,it uses NextAuth.js, a library for handling authentication, to manage user login and authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access a user's documents and account information.
